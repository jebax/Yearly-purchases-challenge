~Yearly Purchases Challenge~

This is a codewars 6kyu challenge: 
"Define a best_monthly method for a set of users, provided as an array with a group of users for each month."
"You must return a nested array of all users who made a purchase in every month, in the format [count, [all, users], next count, [next, users]], sorted by most purchases to least purchases."

I added a few extras, by defining a YearlyUsers class and adding a few other basic methods: returning a list of all users who made purchases, and returning the purchase count for a specific user.

To run: load into IRB.
